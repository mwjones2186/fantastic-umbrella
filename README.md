  ## Description 

  Fantastic Umbrella is a terrible name that gives zero description of my actual application. Hindsight 20/20 I would have deleted this repository and created a new one to better display the actual purpose of this application. With that being said, Fantastic Umbrella is a backend route builder that allows a user to create and store new data into a database. It can pull table data, create table data, select a specific product, category, product tag or simply tag information. .

  For a better understanding of how backend development is routed in order to be scalable and concise. This application can be valuable in a number of diferent uses. Including retail, finance, sports or individual office needs. All catagories, products, product tags and tags can be modified to allow any kind of input to target specific data in which you choose to store or return. .

  This is a great way for one to store info and pull info that is required in a simple and reproducable way. 4 min of set up and one can begin storing data, pulling data and cyphoning the info they need..

  How to route backend API routes, organize my project in a simple way and how to utilize insomnia a bit better. Im learning more about development on a daily basis than my brain can comprehend. The moment I start to vaugely understand a concept, we take a hard left and learn something new. However, those fundamentals are coming full circle and helping me understand what we are accomplishing and this project was a great learning experience in backend routing and JS.

 

  ## Installation
  Clone the repo. Open terminal. NPM i to install all packages. Create a .env file with your mysql credentials. Run mysql and seed the database. Close the mysql terminal. Back in your terminal, run node seeds. That will seed your tables with data. Once application is seeded, run npm start. this will allow you to open insomnia and start GET-ting, POST-ing, DELETE-ing and PUT-ting data into your tables..

  ## Usage

  I see this perfectly in the retail or inventory space. It allows someone to seed product data into a database that can be retrieved at any time. .
